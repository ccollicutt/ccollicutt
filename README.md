# About Me

I'm a technologist who works to make systems safer and easier to use. I try to adopt a socio-technical approach to complex challenges via human-centred solutions. Throughout my career, which has spanned work with university libraries, start-ups and enterprises, I've been a trusted advisor to customers and stakeholders. He is constantly learning and growing, and through organisations like TAICO, he helps others do the same.
