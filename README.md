# About Me

I'm an Advisory Solution Engineer in the Tanzu group at VMware. I like to think I help customers get applications into production, primarily in containers, whether it's in the Cloud Foundry based Tanzu Application Service, or in Kubernetes, or even both!

I've spent a lot of time building infrastructure as a service systems, which always included some kind of software defined networking. Over the last couple of years I've mostly worked with Kubernetes, and am a certified Kubernetes administrator (CKA). At this point I'm focussing a lot on how to get applications into production, as well as how to use Kubernetes to do that.
