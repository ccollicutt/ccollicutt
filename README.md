# About Me

I'm a Senior Solutions Engineer in the Tanzu group at VMware. I like to think I help customers get applications into production, primarily in containers, whether it's in the Cloud Foundry based Tanzu Application Service, or in Kubernetes, or even both!

I've spent a lot of time building infrastructure as a service systems, which always included some kind of software defined networking. Over the last couple of years I've mostly worked with Kubernetes, and am a certified Kubernetes administrator (CKA).
