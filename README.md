# About Me

Recently I have been working with organizations to help them understand what open source dependencies are used in their software, and thus packaged in container images, and how to improve from a security perspective, from all the way left in the coders development environment, to all the way right of the spectrum in the world of runtime security. I help organizations determine what outcomes they need to be a truly successful software business, and then I work with them to build a success plan to achieve those outcomes. 

I've spent a lot of time building infrastructure as a service systems, which alway include some kind of software defined networking. Over the last couple of years I've mostly worked with Kubernetes, and I have held the CKA and CKS certifications.
